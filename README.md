# titanic-survival-prediction-logistic-regression
This repository houses the Titanic Survival Prediction project, which applies logistic regression to predict passenger survival on the Titanic based on demographic and ticket data. Using a semi-cleaned version of the Titanic dataset, this project demonstrates data handling, model training, and evaluation techniques for binary classification. 
# Titanic Survival Prediction Using Logistic Regression

## Project Overview
This project leverages logistic regression to classify Titanic passengers as either survivors or non-survivors based on key passenger information. The model is trained on a semi-cleaned version of the Titanic dataset from Kaggle.

## Dataset Features
The dataset includes various features such as:
- **Passenger Class**: Socio-economic class (1st, 2nd, 3rd)
- **Gender**: Gender of the passenger
- **Age**: Age of the passenger
- **Fare**: Fare paid for the ticket
- **SibSp**: Number of siblings/spouses aboard
- **Parch**: Number of parents/children aboard

## Goals
The goal is to implement logistic regression for classification and analyze the effectiveness of logistic regression in predicting survival probability.

## Repository Structure
- **Data**: Titanic dataset
- **Notebook**: Jupyter notebook for data exploration, preprocessing, and logistic regression implementation.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Data preprocessing and feature selection
- Logistic regression for classification tasks
- Model evaluation techniques
